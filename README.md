What is Snowflake?

Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform that provides a data warehouse-as-a-service. It allows you to store, query, and analyze large volumes of data using standard SQL.

Unlike traditional data warehouses, Snowflake is:

Fully managed (no infrastructure to maintain),

Scalable (automatically handles workloads),

Cloud-native (runs on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud),

Supports structured & semi-structured data (e.g., JSON, Avro, Parquet).
